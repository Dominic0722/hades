Description:
How did the mega-hit dungeon crawler Hades come to be?

This one-of-a-kind video documentary takes you inside developer Supergiant Games for every step of the game’s journey: from before its surprise announcement, to its full launch almost two years later, and beyond, as the game grew into a worldwide phenomenon. The result is a unique chronicle of one of the most celebrated games of 2020, and an insightful look at how a small team can bring a game to life.

Presented in a new director’s cut of the original six-part video documentary series from Noclip’s YouTube channel, this special two-disc Blu-ray set includes a booklet about the project, as well as reversible front jacket.
