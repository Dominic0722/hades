                            Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld, is the daughter of Hades and Persephone, the
                            younger sister of Zagreus and is the main protagonist of Hades II.
                            Melinoë is a chthonic nymph associated with ghosts and nightmares. Before the events
                            precede up to Hades II, while Melinoë's family lived a happy life in the underworld, the
                            titan CHRONOS broke free from his prison deep in Tartarus and took control of the
                            Underworld. On her father's orders, Hecate took Melinoë and trained her to be a titan
                            slayer.
                            Melinoë now must descend to the Underworld and defeat Chronos.</p>

                        <p>

                            Athena is the Olympian Goddess of Wisdom and strategic warfare. She
                            offers boons to Zagreus that cause his abilities to Deflect enemy attacks. In addition, she
                            also offers boons that reduce damage or increase other defensive options.
                            Athena offers excellent defensive options with her boons, protecting you from damage with
                            the ability to deflect enemy projectiles and melee attacks, as well as reduce the damage you
                            will take in a run.
                            Her signature Status Curse is Exposed, which causes enemies to take additional damage from
                            behind. This stacks with Backstab bonuses offered by the Mirror of Night.
                            As her boon is the reward for clearing the very first room in a fresh save, she will always
                            be the first of the Olympian gods to be encountered.
                            Athena returns in Hades II and offers her boons to Melinoë. Unlike the first game, Athena
                            appears in specific chambers in-person and can help clear enemies. She can be encountered
                            on Mount Olympus.</p>

                        <p>Charon is the boatman of the Underworld and transition incarnate, son of Nyx, and responsible
                            for ferrying deceased souls across the river and into the underworld. In Greek mythology, he
                            required a single obol - placed into the mouth before burial - as payment for his services,
                            or else the soul in question would be left to wander the banks of the Styx for a hundred
                            years.
                            Charon's services in-game are, unfortunately, much more expensive; he functions as the
                            game's shopkeeper, selling Zagreus various power-ups, healing items, and boons in return for
                            the obols he collects throughout his escape attempt. He can be found in chambers with a
                            preview showing a brown sack, usually around the mid-length of each biome before a mini-boss
                            encounter and at the penultimate chamber of a biome, before the boss encounter.</p>

                            wanton ransacking of my domain?" - Hades</h4>
                        <p>Hades is the chthonic God of the Underworld and of the mineral riches of the earth, the lord
                            and master of the House of Hades, and the father of Zagreus and Melinoë. He is in charge of
                            maintaining order within the Underworld, determining the placements and punishments of the
                            dead, and hearing the petitions of shades that come before him.
                            Hades is stern, serious, and dedicated to his work. In the Remembrances that play before
                            some escape attempts, he is shown to have been strict and often cruel to Zagreus during his
                            childhood. He employed Achilles to teach Zagreus fighting and give him more of a "firm
                            direction in life." Meanwhile, Hades seems to have left much of the caretaking and raising
                            of Zagreus to Nyx.
                            He is resentful of Zagreus' repeated attempts to escape the Underworld and greets his
                            returns with scorn and mockery. Additionally, he will sometimes order shades to congregate
                            near Zagreus to punish him with time trials or to defend his Infernal Troves, in addition to
                            overseeing the Infernal Gates to Erebus. He berates Zagreus upon the prince managing to
                            progress from Tartarus to Asphodel, from Asphodel to Elysium, and finally from Elysium to
                            the Temple of Styx. After Zagreus successfully bribes Cerberus with a Satyr Sack to let him
                            by without violence, Hades realizes that he needs to become personally involved and heads
                            off to face Zagreus at the snowy grounds on the living side of the Temple's archway, having
                            equipped his Helm of Darkness and his fearsome spear Gigaros, to vanquish his son and banish
                            him back to the House. He is the final boss of the main game.

                        <p>Medea is a witch from Colchis who married the famous Greek hero Jason. After ten years of
                            marriage, Jason annulled his marriage to her and chose instead to wed the daughter of the
                            King of Corinth. As vengeance, Medea killed Jason's new bride and her own sons by him,
                            ensuring that he would have no heir.
                            Medea appears in Hades II and offers her Nightly Curses to Melinoë in her fight
                            against Chronos. She can be encountered on the City of Ephyra.
